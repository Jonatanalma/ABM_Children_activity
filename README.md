# ABM_Children_activity
This is an agent-based model in development.
The code is writen using the GAMA-Platform.

The ABM simulates childrenâ€™s movement, activity and measures physical activity in the urban landscape.
Children follow a daily schedule of activities including: attending school and after school activities such as: playing in the park, formal sport activities, playing around the neighbourhood, meeting a friend and shopping.
For each activity the agents select the relevant land-use for the activity and consider distance and the presence of other children.
Children decide on a transportation mode: walking or a car.
Each child has socio-economic characteristics that are based on data from census zone: socio-economic-state, number of cars, gender and personal charctristics such as tendency to be active.
Physical activity is measured for the agents by minutes of MVPA- medium to vigorous physical activity.
The environment (the city) is based on GIS layers of land-use, roads, buildings and shops.
One cycle in the model represents one minute.
Graphs include distribution of physical activity in the population, duration of landuse usage.
