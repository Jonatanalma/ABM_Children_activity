# ABM_Children_activity
This is an agent-based model in development.
The code is writen using the GAMA-Platform.

The ABM simulates childrenâ€™s movement, activity and measures physical activity in the urban landscape.
Children follow a daily schedule of activities including: going to school and after school activities such as: playing in the park, formal sport activities, playing in the neighbourhood and shopping.
For each activity the agents select the relevant land-use for the activity and consider distance to the land-use and number of other agents that go there.
Children select a transportation mode which is either walking or car.
Each child has socio-economic characteristics that are based on aggregated data from census zone: socio-economic-state, number of cars, gender, and tendency to be active.
Physical activity is measured for the agents by minutes of MVPA- medium to vigorous physical activity.

The environment (the city) is based on GIS layers of land-use, roads, buildings and shops.
One cycle in the model represents one minute.
Graphs include distribution of physical activity in the population, duration in diffrent types of land use and trajectory of MVPA for selected agents.
