# ABM_Children_activity

An agent-based model (ABM) that explores how changes to outdoor play, school-based activities and active travel affect children’s physical activity (PA). Unique to this model is the ability to represent the complexity of multiple interdependent levels including built and social environment, individual characteristics, constraints of time/space, and policy measures, which influence PA. 

The ABM generates a synthetic population of agents representing 9-11 year-olds residing in the city of Glasgow, characterised by socio-economic demographics consistent with census data. The urban environment is represented by geospatial data layers, including land use, houses, schools and street networks. Agents follow a daily schedule: attending school, formal sport, outdoor play and meeting with friends. Agents’ decisions regarding the location of an activity and travel mode are affected by land use availability, accessibility, crime levels and street walkability. As agents engage in activities, they accumulate minutes of moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA). To define the proportion of time spent in MVPA per activity and site we used empirical data of children's PA data collected in the SPACES project. 
The code is written using the GAMA-Platform.
